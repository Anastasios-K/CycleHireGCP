## Overview
An ML project is being undertaken to analyze and model cycle hire data from Google Cloud Platform (GCP). \
In this project, extensive data processing and visual analytics are employed to extract valuable insights  \
from the dataset. Additionally, visually appealing figures are being generated to effectively convey these \
insights. Following the necessary preprocessing and data engineering, the data is being modeled to predict \
the demand at the top 20 busiest cycle stations. H2O AutoML is currently being utilized for this purpose. \
Nevertheless, it is acknowledged that the unique characteristics of the dataset allow for further \
experimentation and refinement.
